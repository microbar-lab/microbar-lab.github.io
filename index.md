# Welcome to MicrobAR Lab!

> *The <ins>Microb</ins>iome and <ins>A</ins>ntimicrobial <ins>R</ins>esistance Laboratory*

<br>

This is the main webpage of `MicrobAR`, the new research group created in 2025 at the [Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics (IBFG)](https://ibfg.usal-csic.es/), a mix center between the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/es) and the [University of Salamanca (USAL)](https://www.usal.es/), placed in the beautiful city of Salamanca (Spain).

<br>

We are interested in investigating the microbiome and the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms emerging and occuring from soil to humans ("One Health). For doing so, we apply DNA/RNA sequencing techonologies (Illumina, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Pacbio; including: metataxonomics, genomics, RNAseq, sRNAseq, metagenomics or metatranscriptomics among others) and we develop and customized bioinformatic frameworks.  
Additionally, we develop software for performing AMR screening in:
- Fungi: <ins>Chro</ins>mosome <ins>Que</ins>ry <ins>Ta</ins>rget<ins>s</ins>, [ChroQueTas](https://github.com/nmquijada/ChroQueTas)
- Bacteria: [TORMES](https://github.com/nmquijada/tormes)

We are very active and involved in many different projects. These are some of the main research lines:  
- Development of software for antifungal resistance.
- Antifungal resistance in *Candidozyma auris*.
- Resistome evolution in human early-life and impact of delivery mode and lactancy.
- Microbial dynamics over cheese microbiome after application of specifically designed synthetic communities.
- Microbial and AMR monitoring in slaughterhouses and households.
