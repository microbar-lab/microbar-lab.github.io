# Welcome to MicrobAR Lab!

> *The <ins>Microb</ins>iome and <ins>A</ins>ntimicrobial <ins>R</ins>esistance Laboratory*

<br>

This is the main webpage of `MicrobAR`, the new research group created in 2025 at the [Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics (IBFG)](https://ibfg.usal-csic.es/), a mix center between the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/es) and the [University of Salamanca (USAL)](https://www.usal.es/), placed in the beautiful city of Salamanca (Spain).

<br>

We are interested in investigating the microbiome and the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms emerging and occuring from soil to humans ("One Health). For doing so, we apply and develop different bioinformatic frameworks to face the state-of-the-art of DNA/RNA sequencing techonologies (Illumina, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Pacbio), including: metataxonomics, genomics, RNAseq, sRNAseq, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics.
